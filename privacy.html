  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>LiveControl Zoom</strong> (“the App,” “we,” “our”) collects, uses, shares, retains, and otherwise processes personal information in connection with the Windows desktop application and related services.</p>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>LiveControl (“we”) provides the LiveControl Zoom application for joining Zoom meetings on a schedule or on demand, including for broadcast and encoder workflows. Contact: support@livecontrol.io.</p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect and process</h2>
  <p>The App is a desktop application that runs on your Windows device. We do not operate a separate backend that receives your data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zoom account and tokens:</strong> When you use “Sign in with Zoom” (OAuth), you authorize Zoom to provide the App with access and refresh tokens. These tokens are stored <strong>only on your device</strong>, encrypted (AES, machine- and user-specific). We do not receive or store these tokens on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Meeting identifiers and passcodes:</strong> Meeting IDs, passcodes, and display names are entered by you or read from your own database by the Runner. They are stored only in local config files on your machine. We do not collect or transmit this data to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>App credentials (Client ID/Secret):</strong> If you use the credential setup tool, credentials are stored only on your device in an encrypted file. We do not have access to them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect, sell, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising. We do not use cookies or similar tracking on any website we may link to from the App or this policy.</p>

  <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
  <p>Because the App processes data only on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Zoom tokens are used solely to authenticate and join Zoom meetings as you request.</li>
    <li>Meeting IDs and passcodes are used only to join the meetings you configure (manually or via your database).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your data for analytics, profiling, or advertising.</p>

  <h2>4. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, except:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As necessary to operate the App (e.g., communication with Zoom’s servers for OAuth and joining meetings, as governed by Zoom’s privacy policy).</li>
    <li>If required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
  <p>All data processed by the App (tokens, meeting IDs, passcodes, config) is stored only on your device. You can delete it at any time by removing the App’s config and credential files or uninstalling the App. We do not retain copies of your data on our systems.</p>

  <h2>6. Data subject rights and how to exercise them</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal information. We support the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request confirmation of what personal data we hold about you. For this App, we do not store your data on our servers; it remains on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> You can correct or update data by editing your local config or re-authorizing with Zoom (Sign out / Sign in with Zoom) in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> You may request deletion of any personal data we might hold. You can also delete local data yourself by clearing the App’s config and credential files and uninstalling the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> Your meeting and auth data is already in local files (config JSON, encrypted credential store); you can copy or delete these files at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Objection / restriction:</strong> You may object to or request restriction of processing. For this App, processing happens on your device; you can stop using the App and remove local data at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> You can revoke Zoom authorization (Sign out in the App) and remove stored tokens. You may also revoke the App in your Zoom account settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>To exercise any of these rights</strong>, contact us at support@livecontrol.io. We will respond within a reasonable time (e.g., 30 days) and, where applicable, in line with local law. If you are in the EEA/UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>Credentials and OAuth tokens are stored on your device using encryption (AES with a machine- and user-specific key). We do not transmit your tokens or meeting credentials to our own servers.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 (or equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).</p>

  <h2>9. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised, and we encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
