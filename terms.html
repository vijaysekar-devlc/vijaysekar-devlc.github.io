  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>
  <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of <strong>LiveControl Zoom</strong> (“the App”), a Windows desktop application provided by LiveControl (“we,” “us,” “our”). By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of the App</h2>
  <p>LiveControl Zoom allows you to join Zoom meetings on a schedule or on demand, including for broadcast, streaming, and encoder workflows. The App uses the Zoom Meeting SDK and Zoom OAuth and may use a companion Runner to launch joins based on a local database or schedule.</p>

  <h2>2. Zoom terms and your account</h2>
  <p>Use of the App requires a Zoom account and use of Zoom’s services. Your use of Zoom is subject to Zoom’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You are responsible for complying with Zoom’s policies and for any meetings you join or authorize the App to join. We are not responsible for Zoom’s services or policies.</p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>You agree to use the App only in compliance with applicable laws and with Zoom’s terms and policies. You must not use the App to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Join meetings without proper authorization or in a way that violates the meeting host’s or Zoom’s rules.</li>
    <li>Record, stream, or distribute meeting content in violation of applicable law or participants’ rights.</li>
    <li>Interfere with Zoom’s services or other users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You are responsible for securing your device, credentials, and any database or config the App uses.</p>

  <h2>4. No warranty</h2>
  <p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation or compatibility with all Zoom account types or meeting settings.</p>

  <h2>5. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, revenue, or profits, arising from your use of the App. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us for the App in the twelve months before the claim (or, if no fee was paid, to zero).</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>The App and its content are owned by us or our licensors. You receive a limited license to use the App in accordance with these Terms. Zoom’s services and branding are owned by Zoom Video Communications, Inc.</p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the App at any time (e.g., by uninstalling it and revoking the App’s access in your Zoom account). We may suspend or discontinue the App or your access with notice where reasonably required. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., disclaimer, limitation of liability) will survive termination.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date will be revised. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

  <h2>9. General</h2>
  <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App. If any part is held unenforceable, the rest remains in effect. Our failure to enforce a right does not waive it. Governing law and venue: the laws of the State of California, USA.</p>
